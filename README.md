# Rust Parquet Data Processing

## Overview

This Rust project demonstrates how to efficiently store and query large datasets using Parquet files. Parquet is a columnar storage format that excels at analytical processing and big data workloads. In this project, we'll walk you through the process of:

- Storing data in Parquet files.
- Querying data from Parquet files.
- Leveraging the benefits of columnar storage and compression for improved performance.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system.
- Familiarity with Rust programming.
- Basic understanding of the Parquet file format.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-parquet-data-processing.git
   cd rust-parquet-data-processing
   ```

2. Build the Rust project using Cargo:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. Run the Rust application:

   ```bash
   cargo run -- /path/to/your/data/folder
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/data/folder` with the actual folder path containing the data you want to process and store in Parquet files.

## Usage

### Storing Data in Parquet Files

The Rust application will iterate over the files in the specified folder, create Arrow record batches for each file, and store them in a Parquet file named `file_mapping.parquet`. The Parquet schema includes fields for "filename" and "filepath," but you can customize it to match your data schema.

### Querying Data from Parquet Files

To query data from Parquet files, you can use various tools and libraries that support the Parquet format. Popular options include:

- [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/rust/arrow/ipc/index.html): Arrow provides tools to read Parquet files into Arrow record batches, making it easy to work with Parquet data in Rust.

- [Apache Parquet Rust](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/rust/parquet): The official Apache Parquet Rust library provides advanced capabilities for reading and writing Parquet files.

- [Apache Drill](https://drill.apache.org/docs/parquet-format/): If you have a distributed data processing ecosystem, you can use tools like Apache Drill to query Parquet files efficiently.

## Configuration

The project's configuration is defined in a `.env` file. Ensure that you configure the `.env` file with the appropriate settings for your PostgreSQL database, folder paths, or any other environment-specific parameters.
